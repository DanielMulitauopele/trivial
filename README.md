## Description/Purpose

This front-end application reflects the final project of Turing School of Software and Design, and serves to function as a mini 'take home' challenge that students can expect receive during the job search. I chose to implement a React front-end, eager to learn more about front-end development and what it takes to be a solid full stack developer.
